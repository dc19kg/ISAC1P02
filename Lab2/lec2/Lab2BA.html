    <h2> What is Lorem Ipsum? </h2>
    <p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting</p>
    <p>industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy</p>
    <p>text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley</p>
    <p>of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has</p>
    <p>survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic</p>
    <p>typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in</p>
    <p>the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem</p>
    <p>Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing</p>
    <p>software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

    <h2> Where does it come from? </h2>
    <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.</p>
    <p>It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,</p>
    <p>making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin</p>
    <p>professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of</p>
    <p>the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum</p>
    <p>passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical</p>
    <p>literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum</p>
    <p>comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum</p>
    <p>et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in</p>
    <p>45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular</p>
    <p>during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem</p>
    <p>ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
    <p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is</p>
    <p>reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and</p>
    <p>1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also</p>
    <p>reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English</p>
    <p>versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>

    <h2> Why do we use it? </h2>
    <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the</p>
    <p>readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of</p>
    <p>using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution</p>
    <p>of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here',</p>
    <p>making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing</p>
    <p>packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their</p>
    <p>default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover</p>
    <p>many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved</p>
    <p>over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose</p>

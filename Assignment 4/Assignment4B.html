    <p>Hello, my name is Deryk Cotton, I am 19 years old, and
    am in my second year at Brock University, majoring in
    Computer Science. I live at home in Fort Erie, with my parents and 3 siblings
    while attending school, on my days off of school, I play video games,
    watch anime,or if it's summer, I play baseball in the Niagara District
    men's league (NDBA). I play many different video games, button
    my favourites are: Rust, Need for Speed: Heat, NHL 22, Rimworld,
    and Factorio. I am currently watching Hunter x Hunter and One
    Piece for my animes. But my favourites are: Black Clover, Naruto,
    and Fire Force. I sometimes stream on Twitch, I play most of the games
    I listed above, but am often to busy with school to make a proper
    schedule. I would have streamed me creating this website but it most
    likely would not be too family friendly (a lot of this was a pain to make).
    When I am done school, I plan on moving to Nova Scotia with my girlfriend and
    getting a job as an IT technician. I am also into game design and website
    design, hence why I took this course. I don't have any background knowledge in
    game design, so I can only make simple games such as this Jeopardy game,
    <a href ="Assignment4C.html" id = "pageNav"> Click here for game </a>
    . If you wish to skip the game, and go back to the intro
    page, <a href ="Assignment4.html" id = "pageNav"> Click here for intro page </a>

    <p> Rules of the game: <br />
    -Capitalization is key (every word should be capitalized)<br />
    -Order in which you answer questions does not matter<br />
    -Do not press button more than once (I am unsure of how to make buttons only one use)<br />
    -Please do not cheat and check the script for the answer <br />
    -Do not tab out when a prompt is available, the prompt will disappear <br />
    -Have fun! </p>
